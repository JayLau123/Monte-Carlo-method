A brief introduction to MC method and its mathematical theory

### A statistical sampling theory to solve physical or mathematical problems approximately.

MC can be used to solve any problem having a probabilistic interpretation. By the law of large numbers, integrals described by the expected value of some random variable can be approximated by taking sample mean of independent samples of the variable. Firstly, establish a probabilistic model or probabilistic process that is associated with the problem and find the relation between the certain eigenvalues or quantities of the probability model and the solution of the problem. Next, use computer to generate some samples randomly, use these sample to estimate some eigenvalue of the distributation so as to approximate the solution to the problem. 

### Some problems are dealt with MC

optimization, numerical integration, deterministic mathematical problems, and probabilistic problems(diffusion of neutrons).
